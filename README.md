# Data Structures

### Lattice
Wrote second pass decoding speech recognition program. Given conversational speech data, a lattice-like acyclic graphical structure is created with edge and node classes using linked-lists. Then a shortest path algorithm based on a language and acoustic model score is used to find most likely sentence uttered.

### Phylo Tree
Constructed tree data structure based on the degree of similarity between species' amino acid sequences. This tree is Implemented with custom linked-list structure and uses Huffman Coding algorithm to create a meaningful structure, pairing the most genetically closely related sub-trees until one tree has formed based on a given 'pivot' species. Provides functionality to manipulate data and gives insight to the relationships between species. Done with a partner--pair programming.
